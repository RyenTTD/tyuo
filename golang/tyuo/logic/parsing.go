//WARNING Disregard all other notes on punctuation and the encoding thereof.
//punctuation will be encoded as standalone tokens, not part of the word to
//which it's attached.
//additionally, this means they won't be chosen as keywords, which sidesteps the
//problem of something like "tyuo, desu?" not matching "desu" in other places.
//Compound punctuation won't be learnable if it's not in the recognised set.
