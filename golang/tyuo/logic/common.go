//the number of sibling-branches to consider for each node in depth-first
//traversal
//the expectation is that each one will produce roughly one result
//Each of the initial branches will be probed, but beyond that, on
//each successive node, each sibling will be tried in order received from the
//database (which is random), and any terminals encountered will produce a
//new forward/reverse option

//NOTE: when looking at transition options, select searchBranches in total, but
//choose anything containing an unencountered keyword first, before doing
//a random/weighted pick of the remainder
//to make this efficient, the keyword-set should be a hash-set, maybe
//with a boolean value set to true/false in each node, if it's expensive to copy it;
//flipped values could be tracked in a slice and restored before returning

//when reaching a stopping point, as the stack is retraversed upwards,
//the next sibling is selected only if there are no candidates from
//traversing the previous branch.

//after falling back to a trigram search, the first terminal found, beyond minDepth,
//will end that discovery path

//when doing a markov walk, choose anything in the keyword set first, if possible
